# Digital Wellness â€” Executive Synopsis

Purpose
- Provide anonymized, privacy-first insights about how learners spend time in the platform.
- Help students and educators spot study-sprint vs distraction patterns and design interventions.

Key Features
- Opt-in consented tracking with local storage and clear UI.
- Anonymized server-side persistence by default; server-side user linking only when explicitly allowed.
- Aggregated dashboards (daily averages, top categories, productivity score) to drive UX improvements.
- Data retention and right-to-forget: configurable deletes and admin controls.

Business Value
- Increased student engagement via personalized recommendations and nudges.
- Measurable KPIs for wellness and study-time improvements for stakeholders.
- Privacy-first approach reduces legal/regulatory risk.

Next steps for production hardening
- Add idempotent server-side dedupe (unique constraint) and deterministic session IDs.
- Add scheduled retention job (cron) using a secure service account.
- Add analytics pipeline and aggregation cache (Redis) for large scale.
